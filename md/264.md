# Ugly Number II

An **ugly number** is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to `2`, `3`, and `5`.

Given an integer `n`, return *the* `nth` ***ugly number***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1690`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        vector<int> v;
        v.push_back(1);
        for (int i = 0, j = 0, k = 0; v.size() < n;) {
            int t = min(v[i] * 2, min(v[j] * 3, v[k] * 5));
            v.push_back(t);
            if (v[i] * 2 == t) i++;
            if (v[j] * 3 == t) j++;
            if (v[k] * 5 == t) k++;
        }
        return v.back();
    }
};
```
