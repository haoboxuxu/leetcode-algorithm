# Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree



Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are **sorted in ascending order**, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: head = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`

``` c++
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* sortedListToBST(ListNode* head) {
        if (!head) return nullptr;
        int n = 0;
        for (auto p = head; p; p = p->next) n++;
        if (n == 1) return new TreeNode(head->val);

        auto cur = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2 - 1; i++) cur = cur->next;

        auto root = new TreeNode(cur->next->val);
        root->right = sortedListToBST(cur->next->next);
        cur->next = nullptr;
        root->left = sortedListToBST(head);
        return root;
    }
};
```
