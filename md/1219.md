# Path with Maximum Gold

In a gold mine `grid` of size `m x n`, each cell in this mine has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, `0` if it is empty.

Return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the conditions:

- Every time you are located in a cell you will collect all the gold in that cell.
- From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
- You can't visit the same cell more than once.
- Never visit a cell with `0` gold.
- You can start and stop collecting gold from **any** position in the grid that has some gold.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,6,0],[5,8,7],[0,9,0]]
Output: 24
Explanation:
[[0,6,0],
 [5,8,7],
 [0,9,0]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 9 -> 8 -> 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,0,7],[2,0,6],[3,4,5],[0,3,0],[9,0,20]]
Output: 28
Explanation:
[[1,0,7],
 [2,0,6],
 [3,4,5],
 [0,3,0],
 [9,0,20]]
Path to get the maximum gold, 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 15`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
- There are at most **25** cells containing gold.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int n, m;
    int res;
    int getMaximumGold(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        n = grid.size(), m = grid[0].size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != 0) dfs(grid, i, j, 0);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }

    int dx[4] = {0, 1, 0, -1}, dy[4] = {1, 0, -1, 0};

    void dfs(vector<vector<int>>& grid, int x, int y, int gold) {
        gold += grid[x][y];
        res = max(res, gold);
        int t = grid[x][y];
        grid[x][y] = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int a = x + dx[i], b = y + dy[i];
            if (a >= 0 && a < n && b >= 0 && b < m && grid[a][b] != 0) dfs(grid, a, b, gold);
        }
        grid[x][y] = t;
    }
};
```
