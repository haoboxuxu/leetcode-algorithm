# Palindrome Number

Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 121
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        if (x < 0) return 0;
        long long rx = 0;
        int t = x;
        while (t) {
            rx = rx * 10 + t % 10;
            t /= 10;
        }
        return rx == x;
    }
};
```
