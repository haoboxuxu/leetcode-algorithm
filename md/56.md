# Merge Intervals

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

**NOTE:** input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

```java
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& a) {
        vector<vector<int>> res;
        if (a.empty()) return res;
        sort(a.begin(), a.end());
        int l = a[0][0], r = a[0][1];
        for (int i = 1; i < a.size(); i++) {
            if (r < a[i][0]) {
                res.push_back({l, r});
                l = a[i][0], r = a[i][1];
            } else {
                r = max(r, a[i][1]);
            }
        }
        res.push_back({l, r});
        return res;
    }
};
```
