# House Robber II

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;
        else if (n == 1) return nums[0];
        else if (n == 2) return max(nums[0], nums[1]);
        return max(rob1(nums, 0, n - 2), rob1(nums, 1, n - 1));
    }
    
    int rob1(vector<int>& nums, int l, int r) {
        int f = nums[l], s = max(nums[l], nums[l+1]);
        for (int i = l+2; i <= r; i++) {
            int t = s;
            s = max(f + nums[i], s);
            f = t;
        }
        return s;
    }
};
```
