# Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104`
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == nullptr) return 0;
        int level = 0;
        TreeNode* node = root;
        while (node->left != nullptr) {
            level++;
            node = node->left;
        }
        int low = 1<<level, high = (1<<(level+1)) - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (high - low + 1) / 2 + low;
            if (exist(root, level, mid)) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
    
    bool exist(TreeNode* root, int level, int k) {
        int bits = 1<<(level-1);
        TreeNode* node = root;
        while (node != nullptr && bits > 0) {
            if (!(bits&k)) {
                node = node->left;
            } else {
                node = node->right;
            }
            bits >>= 1;
        }
        return node != nullptr;
    }
};
```
