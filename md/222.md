# Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 104]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 104`
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;
        auto l = root->left, r = root->right;
        int lc = 1, rc = 1;
        while (l) l = l->left, lc++;
        while (r) r = r->right, rc++;
        if (lc == rc) return (1 << lc) - 1;
        return countNodes(root->left) + 1 + countNodes(root->right);
    }
};
```
