# Candy

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return *the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> f, ratings;
    int n;
    int candy(vector<int>& _ratings) {
        n = _ratings.size();
        ratings = _ratings;
        f.resize(n, -1);

        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) res += dp(i);
        return res;
    }

    int dp(int x) {
        if (f[x] != -1) return f[x];
        f[x] = 1;
        if (x > 0 && ratings[x - 1] < ratings[x]) f[x] = max(f[x], dp(x - 1) + 1);
        if (x + 1 < n && ratings[x + 1] < ratings[x]) f[x] = max(f[x], dp(x + 1) + 1);
        return f[x];
    }
};
```
