# Candy

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

- Each child must have at least one candy.
- Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return *the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ratings = [1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == ratings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `0 <= ratings[i] <= 2 * 104`



```c++
// sol1
class Solution {
public:
    int candy(vector<int>& ratings) {
        int len = (int)ratings.size();
        vector<int> left(len);
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (i > 0 && ratings[i] > ratings[i-1]) {
                left[i] = left[i-1] + 1;
            } else {
                left[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        int right = 0, res = 0;
        for (int i = len-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (i < len-1 && ratings[i] > ratings[i+1]) {
                right++;
            } else {
                right = 1;
            }
            res += max(left[i], right);
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
