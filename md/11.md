# Container With Most Water

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) return 0;
        int len = height.length;
        int l = 0, r = len - 1;
        int res = 0;

        while (l < r) {
            int h = Math.min(height[l], height[r]);
            res = Math.max(res, h * (r - l));
            if (height[l] < height[r]) {
                l++;
            } else {
                r--;
            }
        }

        return res;
    }
}
```
