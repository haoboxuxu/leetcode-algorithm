# Burst Balloons

Given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n-1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If the you burst balloon `i` you will get `nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right]` coins. Here `left` and `right` are adjacent indices of `i`. After the burst, the `left` and `right` then becomes adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

**Note:**

- You may imagine `nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1`. They are not real therefore you can not burst them.
- 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 500, 0 ≤ `nums[i]` ≤ 100

**Example:**

```
Input: [3,1,5,8]
Output: 167 
Explanation: nums = [3,1,5,8] --> [3,5,8] -->   [3,8]   -->  [8]  --> []
             coins =  3*1*5      +  3*5*8    +  1*3*8      + 1*8*1   = 167
```

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxCoins(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> a(n+2, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) a[i] = nums[i-1];
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+2, vector<int>(n+2));
        for (int len = 3; len <= n+2; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i+len-1 <= n+1; i++) {
                int j = i+len-1;
                for (int k = i+1; k < j; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + a[i] * a[k] * a[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n+1];
    }
};
```
