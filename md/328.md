# Odd Even Linked List

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return *the reordered list*.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == `number of nodes in the linked list
- `0 <= n <= 104`
- `-106 <= Node.val <= 106`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
        auto pH = new ListNode(-1), qH = new ListNode(-1);
        auto p = pH, q = qH, cur = head;
        bool flag = true;
        while (cur) {
            if (flag) {
                p = p->next = cur;
            } else {
                q = q->next = cur;
            }
            flag = !flag;
            cur = cur->next;
        }
        p->next = qH->next;
        q->next = nullptr;
        return pH->next;
    }
};
```
