# Edit Distance

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return *the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`*.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

- Insert a character
- Delete a character
- Replace a character

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 500`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int minDistance(string a, string b) {
        int n = a.size(), m = b.size();
        a = ' ' + a, b = ' ' + b;
        vector<vector<int>> f(n + 1, vector<int>(m + 1));

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) f[i][0] = i;
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) f[0][i] = i;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
                f[i][j] = min(f[i - 1][j], f[i][j - 1]) + 1;
                int t = a[i] != b[j];
                f[i][j] = min(f[i][j], f[i - 1][j - 1] + t);
            }
        }

        return f[n][m];
    }
};
```
