# Repeated DNA Sequences

The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

- For example, `"ACGAATTCCG"` is a **DNA sequence**.

When studying **DNA**, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence**, return all the **`10`-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
        unordered_map<string, int> mp;
        for (int i = 0; i + 10 <= s.size(); i++) {
            mp[s.substr(i, 10)]++;
        }
        vector<string> res;
        for (auto [k, v] :  mp) {
            if (v > 1) res.push_back(k);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
