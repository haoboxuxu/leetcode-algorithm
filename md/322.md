# Coin Change

You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money.

Return *the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount*. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: coins = [1,2,5], amount = 11
Output: 3
Explanation: 11 = 5 + 5 + 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: coins = [2], amount = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: coins = [1], amount = 0
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= coins.length <= 12`
- `1 <= coins[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= amount <= 104`

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int coinChange(vector<int>& coins, int amount) {
        vector<int> dp(amount + 1, 1e8);
        dp[0] = 0;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            for (int j = coin; j <= amount; j++) {
                dp[j] = min(dp[j], dp[j-coin] + 1);
            }
        }
        if (dp[amount] == 1e8) return -1;
        else return dp[amount];
    }
};
```
