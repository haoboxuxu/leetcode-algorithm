# Reverse Words in a String

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "  hello world!  "
Output: "world! hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

 

**Note:**

- A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
- Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
- You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

```java
class Solution {
    public static String reverseWords(String s) {
        s = s.trim();
        int j = s.length() - 1, i = j;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (i >= 0) {
            while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) != ' ') i--;
            sb.append(s.substring(i+1, j+1) + " ");
            while (i >= 0 && s.charAt(i) == ' ') i--;
            j = i;
        }
        return sb.toString().trim();
    }
}
```
