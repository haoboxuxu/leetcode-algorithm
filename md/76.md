# Minimum Window Substring

Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window substring** of* `s` *such that every character in* `t` *(**including duplicates**) is included in the window. If there is no such substring**, return the empty string* `""`*.*

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

 

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string minWindow(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, int> hs, ht;
        for (auto c : t) ht[c]++;

        string res;
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            hs[s[i]]++;
            if (hs[s[i]] <= ht[s[i]]) cnt++;
            while (hs[s[j]] > ht[s[j]]) hs[s[j++]]--;
            if (cnt == t.size()) {
                if (res.empty() || i - j + 1 < res.size()) {
                    res = s.substr(j, i - j + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
