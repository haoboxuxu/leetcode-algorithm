# 2Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3 
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3. 
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```



```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> mp;
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; j < s.size(); j++) {
            mp[s[j]]++;
            while (mp[s[j]] > 1) mp[s[i++]]--;
            res = max(res, j - i + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
